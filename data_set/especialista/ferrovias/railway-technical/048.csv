"1","What is the name of the block system that has been developed by signalling technology?","Moving Block The Theory "
"2","What has been the focus of signalling technology in recent years?","Attempts to get rid of fixed blocks altogether "
"3","How can you get rid of fixed blocks?","Vary the distances between trains according to their actual speed and according their speeds in relation to each other "
"4","What does the Moving Block The Theory look like for speed separation?","Freeway rules "
"5","What would you do if you are moving at the same speed as he is?","You could, in theory, travel immediately behind him and, when he brakes, you do "
"6","How close can a train run for reaction time to his brake lights and variations in braking performance?","A few metres "
"7","What does the Moving Block The Theory need to do to disprove the theory for road traffic?","A few spectacular collisions on the freeways "
"8","How can trains run in theory if they are travelling at the same speed as the one in front?","As close together as a few metres "
"9","How close can trains run at 50 km h?","50 metres "
"10","What happened in Germany where a train derailed, struck a bridge and stopped very quickly?","ICE high speed accident "
"11","What is the safety value of the moving block system?","It is essential to "
"12","What is a good way to make the block locations and lengths consistent with train location and speed?","Maintain a safe braking distance between trains at all times "
"13","What is worth doing to maintain a safe braking distance between trains?","Making the block locations and lengths consistent with train location and speed "
"14","What is a good way to maintain a safe braking distance between trains?","Making them movable rather than fixed "
"15","What is radio transmission called?","Communications Based Train Control CBTC or Transmission Based Signalling TBS "
"16","What is the name of the radio transmission system on a moving block equipped railway?","Moving Block and Radio Transmission "
"17","On a moving block equipped railway, what is the line usually divided into?","The line is usually divided into areas or regions, each area under the control of a computer and each with its own radio transmission system "
"18","What is the name of the train that transmits the data to?","The following train "
"19","How is the radio link between each train and the area computer continuous?","The computer knows the location of all the trains in its area all the time "
"20","What does the radio link transmit to each train to enable it to stop before it reaches that train?","Braking curve "
"21","What is Communications Based Train Control CBTC?","Dynamic distancetogo system "
"22","How many fixed block features have been retained?","One "
"23","What happens if the radio link is lost?","The latest data retained on board the following train will cause it to stop before it reaches the preceding train "
"24","What is a step too far into virtual reality for most operators?","50 km h with 50 metres between them "
"25","What is the name of the freeway style vision of two trains moving at 50 km h with 50 metres between them?","Moving Block Location Updates "
"26","What are the Moving Block Location Updates?","As we have "
