"4","What systems are being upgraded?","UK train radio system and fixed telephone network "
"5","What will the failure of the GSMR project to maintain parallel implementation with ETCS do?","Delay the implementation of train control interoperability in the UK "
"6","What is an issue for GSMR?","Bandwidth "
"7","What could happen to the system?","Emergency traffic might overload the system "
"8","What will require GSMR or satellite based train control systems?","Ground based validation passive Eurobalises "
"9","What is the name of the railway that will allow trains to move freely between ETCS fitted highspeed lines and community railways?","Conventional Community Railways "
"10","The ETCS technical requirements for conventional railways are not yet published but it is very likely that what?","The equipment will be similar to and compatible with that required for highspeed lines "
