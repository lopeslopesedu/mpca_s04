"3","How is the motor mounted in the centre of the bogie?","Longitudinally "
"4","What is required to compensate for the operation of the rubber tyres round curves?","Differential gears "
"5","What does Monomotor Bogie require to accommodate the motor?","Special bogie frame construction "
"6","What does the standard railway track have to have to accommodate a rubber tyred train?","Concrete strips laid on the outside of the conventional rails "
"7","What do steel guide rails act as?","Positive and negative traction current rails "
"8","What is the principal of some urban railways?","Linear motor "
"9","What is shown in a simple diagram of the linear motor?","The principal "
"10","What are the two main components of the conventional DC motor?","The stator and a moving part the rotor "
"11","What is the rotor connected to the axle?","Pinion gear arrangement "
"12","What happens when the motor is connected to the axle by a pinion gear arrangement?","When the armature turns, the wheel turns "
"13","What happens to the linear motor?","The two parts are separated with one placed on the train and the other on the track "

"20","What were originally designed so that the motors were controlled directly by the driver?","Electric locomotives "
"21","What passed through a large controller mounted in the driving cab?","Traction power circuits "
"22","What was a handle rotated by the driver as necessary to do?","Change the switches in the circuit to increase or reduce power as required "
"23","What did the driver have to remain close to the motors?","Long and heavy, powercarrying cables were to be avoided "
"24","What did the desire to get rapid turnrounds on city streetcar railways lead to?","Remote control "
"25","What was the idea that driver s controls could be placed at each end of the train?","If the motors could be remotely controlled "
"26","What would not be necessary to have a locomotive added at the rear of an arriving train?","To allow it to make the return journey "
"27","What did the driver have to do with a cab at each end of the train?","Change ends to change direction "
"28","Where were the motors placed?","Anywhere along the train "
