"1","What is the first part of an ATC system?","The ATC Package "
"2","What is the first part of the ATC package?","Limit of Movement Authority LMA "
"3","What is the LMA based on?","Current speed, its braking capability and the distance it can go before it must stop "
"4","What does the driver manage on a manually driven train?","Through a combination of route and stock knowledge and the visual information received from wayside signals "
"5","On the automated train, the data for the LMA is transmitted from what?","The track to the train "
"6","What is the data for the LMA electronically plotted in the form of?","A braking curve "
"7","What will automatically apply to bring the train to a stand or at least within the permitted speed?","The brakes "
"8","What is the driving part of the ATC system?","Automatic Train Operation ATO "
"9","What is the second part of the ATC system?","Driving part of the operation "
"10","What happens when a driver initiates the start of a train?","Slows it where necessary for speed restrictions and stops at designated stations in the correct location "
"11","What system will carry out the parts of the operation with the exception that the driver normally initiates the train start?","The ATO system "
"12","What do the ATO functions involve?","Data communication between the train and the train "
"13","The data received by the ATP control unit is usually limited to what?","Indicating that a train is in the block or the speed limit currently imposed in the block "
"14","Where is the data sent to?","ATS computer "
"15","What is the timetable to determine?","If the train is running according to schedule or is late or early "
"16","Who can send commands to the ATO spots located along the track?","The ATS "
"17","What are the ATO spots called?","Beacons or balises "
"18","What do some spots transmit data about?","The time the train should stop the dwell time at the station "
"19","What system prevents the train from starting or restricting its speed?","ATP "
"20","Which computer tells the ATP control unit to transmit a restricted speed or zero speed to the track?","ATS computer "
"21","Who picks up both ATP and ATO commands?","Receivers "
"22","Why is the ATO overridden?","The driver stopping the train in the stations by use of the cab controls "
"23","What is the basis upon which the train is allowed to run?","ATP provides safety "
"24","What system provides controls to replace the driver?","ATO "
