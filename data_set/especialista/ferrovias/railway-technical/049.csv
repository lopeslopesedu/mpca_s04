"1","What is the name of the system that claims the distinction of being the first moving block system?","An Early Moving Block System "
"2","What is the name of the first moving block system?","Alcatel "
"3","Where is the Seltrac system used?","Docklands Light Railway "
"4","What is the transmission medium?","Trackmounted induction loops "
"5","What is passed between the vehicle onboard computer VOBC and the vehicle control centre VCC through the loops?","Data "
"6","What does the VCC do?","The VCC controls the speed of Train 2 by checking the position of Train 1 and calculating its safe braking curve "
"7","What does the Seltrac system require?","No driver "
"8","What is used to verify the position of a train not under the control of the loops?","Axle counters "
"9","What is the biggest drawback of the Seltrac system?","Continuous cables "
"10","What does Seltrac use?","Electromagnetic transmission of data "
"11","What type of transmission does Seltrac use?","Radio based transmission "
"12","What has traditionally required a large amount of expensive hardware to be distributed all along a route that is exposed to variable climatic conditions, wear,","The Moving Block Why Do We Need It Railway signalling "
"13","Why is the Moving Block Why Do We Need It Railway signalling expensive?","Maintenance is expensive and often restricted to times when trains are not running "
"14","What is difficult for a system that requires a train to be manually driven?","Failures "
"15","How difficult is it to locate and reach on metros?","Difficult "
"16","Where is access restricted on metros?","Tunnels and elevated sections "
"17","Who has been trying to reduce the wayside signalling equipment?","Railway operators "
"18","What can a reduced wayside equipment lead to?","Reduced installation costs "
"19","What does moving block require?","Less wayside equipment "
"20","What is another goal sought after by operators in Hong Kong?","Greater capacity "
"21","What is the norm for most metro lines?","30 trains per hour tph or a twominute headway "
"22","Why is it debatable whether much improvement is possible for a high capacity system?","Major losses of line capacity occurring because of station stops and terminal operations "
"23","How long will dwell times in Hong Kong be at peak times?","4050 seconds "
"24","How long is the headway for metro lines?","Two minutes or longer "
"25","Where do similar problems exist?","Terminals where crossover clearance times are critical "

"30","How much separation does moving block signalling allow?","50 metre "
"31","What does moving block signalling reduce?","Benefits of moving block "
"32","Who could win the real prize of moving block signalling?","An operator using moving "
