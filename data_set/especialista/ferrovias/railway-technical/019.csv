"1","What is the name of the system that allows trains to operate at high frequency and varying speeds of the same track?","MultiAspect Signalling "
"2","What is the MultiAspect Signalling?","Division a line into blocks or sections "
"3","What does the MultiAspect Signalling mean?","The degree of the restriction becomes dependent on the length of the blocks "
"4","What is the ultimate restriction on the capacity of the railway?","Length of the longest block "
"5","What became critical on routes where traffic developed to a level where more trains were required?","Block length "
"6","What could only be increased by reducing block length?","Capacity "
"7","What will not allow the operation of higher speed trains unless the signalling is arranged to provide warning of the state of several blocks ahead?","Shorter blocks "
"8","What is the name of the type of signalling that allows trains to operate at high frequency and varying speeds of the same track?","Multiaspect signalling "
"9","What is the purpose of multiaspect signalling?","To allow a mix of trains to operate at high frequency and varying speeds of the same track "
"10","How long are block lengths in the UK?","1100m "
"11","What color allows full speed running?","Green "
"12","What aspect shows two clear blocks ahead?","Double yellow "
"13","What type of signalling system uses red, yellow and green aspects?","3aspect "
"14","What other systems are used to indicate the number of blocks free or the required speed limit?","Sequences of flashing lights and multiple lights "
"15","What are turnouts provided where tracks are divided or joined?","Routing Systems "
"16","What is provided where tracks are divided or joined?","Turnouts "
"17","What is a requirement that turnouts are when selected?","Mechanically secured and electrically monitored whilst trains are approaching and traversing the route "
"18","What is known as multiaspect signalling?","Process "
"19","What is also used to prevent conflicting routes or movements being set up?","Interlocking "
"20","Routes are protected by what which cannot show a proceed aspect unless the route over which trains can admit trains is set, locked and proved locked?","Signals "
"21","What can an interlocking be controlled by?","Manned, local signal cabin, a remote control room or through an automated computer control programme supervised from the control room "
"22","What is normal to provide the interlocking equipment and its safety systems local to?","Turnouts "
"23","What were the limitations of the interlocking system?","Mechanical locking systems and control rodding "
"24","What can an interlocking be controlled by a manned, local signal cabin?","Remote control "
"25","What does signal in routebased systems provide drivers with?","Visual indications showing the route set up "
"26","What does a signal in routebased systems assume that information about the speed limits on diverging routes is provided separately?","Fixed sign at the track side "
"27","What does not necessarily provide route indications?","Speedbased systems "
